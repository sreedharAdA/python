    The fact is, IT is a broad term. It covers the use of technology, computers, and software to achieve operational efficiency. IT companies, in turn, address all these things but software companies only address one component (you guessed it – software).

Often, the confusion starts here because these types of companies are in the same industry. However, while these companies are part of the same sector, IT companies and software companies have different roles. Still, even once we tackle that concept, it can be a challenge to pinpoint their specialties. To combat this, let’s take a quick look at how to define each company type. 

WHAT IS AN IT COMPANY?
An IT (information technology) company oversees the use of devices storing, retrieving, and sending information.

WHAT IS A SOFTWARE COMPANY? 
A software company creates products that take the form of various types of software. They work on technology, distribution, and product development.

Still looking for more clarity? We’ve got you covered. In the following sections, we’ll get into more detail about what IT companies do and what software companies do. 

WHAT DOES AN IT COMPANY DO?
An IT company has several different responsibilities that are the key to success in business. They do a lot of work behind the scenes, aside from making sure that your computers are working. IT companies make it possible for people to leverage systems and devices to keep things running smoothly in their organizations. Every day, they help teams use to access information, communicate and automate tasks through technology. Most of these tasks fall into one of three categories:

Function
Infrastructure
Governance
Now, let’s take a closer look at what an IT company does on a day to day basis. 

Function

This is what comes to mind for most when thinking about what IT companies do. IT companies are responsible for making sure that operations are running the way they should. They ensure that devices are working properly and that data is secure. IT is also responsible for installing new software, hardware and providing technical support. As a whole, IT assists with device, software and data management across the entire organization that they’re working with.  

Infrastructure

The IT department also has to make sure that all systems are in place based on the needs of the company that they’re working for. This means that all IT manages hardware, networks, and other functions in accordance with what the organization requires to run smoothly. 

Governance

The IT department also has the task of overseeing the use of systems and networks. The create parameters for how teams inside companies use technology and what it’s used for. They also create policies that determine what information is accessible and what users have permission to access it. 

While IT and software companies do share some of the same responsibilities as IT companies, there are clear differences between the two. Next, let’s dig into what software companies do.
